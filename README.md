# Markdown to PDF Converter API

A powerful and easy-to-use API service that converts Markdown text into high-quality PDF documents. Built with FastAPI and Playwright, and ready to be deployed as a Docker container.

## Features

- **High-Quality Rendering**: Uses a real browser engine (Chromium) for accurate rendering.
- **LaTeX Math Support**: Beautifully renders LaTeX math formulas using KaTeX.
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: Supports tables, strikethrough, and other GFM features.
- **API-First Design**: Easy to integrate with other services and workflows.
- **Containerized**: Simple to deploy and run anywhere with Docker.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## How to Run

This service is designed to be run as a Docker container.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

First, build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`. Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t md2pdf-service .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can start the service with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8020:8020 md2pdf-service
```

This will start the API server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8020`.

## How to Use the API

The API provides a single endpoint to convert Markdown to PDF.

### Interactive API Docs (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the API is through the interactive documentation (Swagger UI), which is automatically generated by FastAPI.

- **Open your browser and navigate to**: [http://localhost:8020/docs](http://localhost:8020/docs)

From there, you can directly paste your Markdown text and get the PDF file back.

### Using curl

You can also use any HTTP client, like `curl`, to send a request.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8020/convert" \
-H "Content-Type: text/markdown" \
--data-binary "@path/to/your/file.md" \
-o output.pdf
```

- Replace `@path/to/your/file.md` with the path to your local Markdown file.
- The generated PDF will be saved as `output.pdf`.

## For Local Development (Optional)

If you want to run the service locally without Docker:

1.  **Install dependencies using `uv`**:
    ```bash
    # This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies
    uv pip sync pyproject.toml
    ```
2.  **Install Playwright browser dependencies**:
    ```bash
    uv run playwright install chromium
    ```
3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    # --reload will automatically restart the server when you change the code
    uv run uvicorn server:app --reload
    ```
