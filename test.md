**Generated:**2025-09-23T21:40:17.071193

## Executive Summary

The **FX Digital Option Model** is integral in assessing currency risk, providing a structured framework for calculating the Value at Risk (VaR) associated with these financial instruments. Developed within the **Global Markets Risk Model (GMRM)**, this model facilitates the valuation of European digital options, which promise a predetermined payout based on the underlying exchange rate relative to a specified strike price. As volatility in the global market increases due to geopolitical influences and economic shifts, accurate estimation of risk exposure using this model is critical.

Recent evaluations of the model indicate a total mark-to-market (MTM) position of **89,413**, alongside a 99% VaR estimate, serving as a key indicator of potential losses over a specified timeframe. These metrics inform ongoing **stress-testing procedures**, ensuring that our risk management practices remain robust and responsive to changing market conditions. Through continuous monitoring and periodic approvals, the model will adapt to evolving market dynamics, demonstrating its relevance in today's financial environment.

## Product Description

### Statement of Model Payoff 

For **cash-settled FX digital call options**, the payoff at maturity depends on the relationship between the exchange rate ($ S_T $) and the strike price ($ K $). If $ S_T < K $, no payoff is realized; conversely, if $ S_T \geq K $, the payoff is a fixed amount $ Q $. In the case of **cash-settled FX digital put options**, the payoff structure mirrors that of the call option, where if $ S_T > K $, the option results in no payout. If $ S_T \leq K $, the payoff is again a fixed amount $ Q $.

For **asset-settled FX digital options**, the payoff dynamics adjust slightly. For a digital call option, the payoff is $ \frac{S_T Q}{K} $ if $ S_T \geq K $; if the exchange rate falls below the strike price, no payout occurs. Conversely, an asset-settled FX digital put option pays out $ \frac{S_T Q}{K} $ when $ S_T \leq K $, yielding nothing if $ S_T > K $. This structured payoff framework illustrates how market observables influence financial outcomes for both cash and asset-settled options.

| Option Type                | Condition                 | Payoff                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cash Settlement Digital Call| $ S_T < K $             | 0                              |
|                            | $ S_T \geq K $         | $ Q $                        |
| Cash Settlement Digital Put | $ S_T > K $             | 0                              |
|                            | $ S_T \leq K $         | $ Q $                        |
| Asset Settlement Digital Call| $ S_T < K $            | 0                              |
|                            | $ S_T \geq K $         | $ \frac{S_T Q}{K} $         |
| Asset Settlement Digital Put | $ S_T > K $            | 0                              |
|                            | $ S_T \leq K $         | $ \frac{S_T Q}{K} $         |

## Model Description

### Modeling Assumptions and Relevant Theory

The FX Digital Option Model is based on the premise that the exchange rate follows **geometric Brownian motion (GBM)**, articulated through the stochastic differential equation:

$$
\frac { d S } { S } = (r_d - r_f) d t + \sigma_t d W_t
$$ 

In this equation, $ r_d $ and $ r_f $ represent the deterministic, continuously compounded risk-free rates for the domestic and foreign currencies, respectively, while $ \sigma_t $ denotes the instantaneous volatility of the exchange rate. The model captures both cash-settled and asset-settled FX digital options, with the former guaranteeing a fixed payout $ Q $ based on the option's in-the-money status, while the latter pays a fraction of the spot exchange rate relative to the strike price at maturity. 

Pricing for cash-settlement options can be determined using the formulas:

$$
c = Q e^{-r T} N(d_2), \quad p = Q e^{-r T} N(-d_2)
$$ 

where 

$$
d_2 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / K) + (r_d - r_f - \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}.
$$ 

For asset-settlement options, the respective payoffs are calculated as:

$$
c = \frac{S_0 Q}{K} e^{-r T} N(d_1), \quad p = \frac{S_0 Q}{K} e^{-r T} N(-d_1)
$$ 

with

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / K) + (r_d - r_f + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}.
$$ 

Both formulations incorporate key variables such as the initial spot exchange rate $ S_0 $, time to maturity $ T $, and strike price $ K $, thereby providing a comprehensive analytical framework for assessing FX digital option pricing.

### Relationship to Previous Models

The current model retains its status as a **previously vetted model**, with no modifications made since the last review. This stability builds confidence in the model's validity and reliability.

## Input Data

### List of Input Data and Sources

The input data for the evaluation of FX digital options largely comprises **Trade Data** and **Market Data** sourced via an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. Trade data is obtained from the Global Trading report located at `/opt/dslprod/reposite/data/gmrm/TOR_EXOTICA/exotica.all.20101104.1.orig` on designated servers. This data is fully integrated into the staging tables and subsequently loaded into the EWD data warehouse, adhering to specific ETL-2 rules to ensure proper mapping and processing. Notably, unique ETL-1 rules are not required for the FX digital option due to its straightforward processing demands, whereas trade data undergoes dynamic transformation into RiskWatch input through ETL-3, with corresponding rules detailed in the ETL3 section.

Market data for FX digital options is sourced from the HMD of GMRM, where discount curves and volatility surfaces are selected based on currency-related criteria. Depending on the option's currency, either a lease curve or swap curve is utilized, as clarified in the ETL3 rules section. Similarly, volatility surface selection depends on both the optionâ€™s currency and its underlying currency. This systematic approach guarantees that trade evaluation processes rely on accurate and relevant data inputs, in line with industry standards and best practices.

### Trade Data Flow

As of Nov 4, 2010, two FX digital options traded. The data for the FX digital option trades transpires from the report line Global/RBFG/Global Trading/Global Debt Markets/Fixed Income and Currencies/FIC London/FIC London - FX/LFX Derivatives/TOR_EXOTICA_EURO MAIN.

The source file can be found at  
`/opt/dslprod/reposite/data/gmrm/TOR_EXOTICA/exotica.all.20101104.1.orig` on either `usgmrd44.fg.rbc.com` or `usgmrd33.fg.rbc.com`.

An adapted source file containing only the two FX digital options is attached for reference.

Following the ETL-1 process, the source file is loaded into staging tables. No special business rules apply to FX digital options, thus no ETL-1 rules are documented for them.

Through the ETL-2 process, the trade data is loaded into the EWD data warehouse. Detailed ETL-2 rules for FX digital options are available on SharePoint: [ETL-2 Rules for FX Digital Options](#). A hard copy is also attached for reference.

### Market Data

All market data derives from HMD of GMRM.

Regarding the discount curve, either a lease curve or swap curve is applicable depending on the currency of the FX digital option. This definition is stipulated in the ETL3 rules in the relevant section.

In terms of the volatility surface, the appropriate curve is determined based on the currency and underlying currency of the FX digital option, as outlined in the ETL3 rules section.

### Input Data Assumptions

In our financial modeling framework, we employ a **swap curve** for calculating essential **discount factors**, which are crucial for present value calculations. Accurate discount factors significantly influence the valuation of all related cash flows, necessitating adherence to market conventions to ensure compliance with current economic conditions.

To assess the **volatility** used in the model, we leverage the *At-The-Money (ATM) Moneyness/Term volatility surface*, providing insight into how volatility varies with different maturities and levels of moneyness. By implementing sourcing, transformation, and selection rules, we ensure the data remains robust and indicative of prevailing market sentiments. It is vital to stress that the model's integrity relies on high-quality, real-time market data sources to bolster the analytical outcomes derived from it.

> Assuring input data fidelity not only enhances model reliability but also instills confidence in the analytical results derived from it.

### Calibration Steps and Frequency

The calibration process for the model is characterized by a clear *parameterization stance*: there are no free parameters beyond the inputs, streamlining our pursuit of model accuracy and reliability. This configuration ensures that the model operates exclusively based on provided inputs, minimizing overfitting potential and confirming that all parameters reflect observable, relevant metrics. Consequently, no explicit calibration requirements are imposed by external factors; the core data utilized remains pivotal in maintaining operational integrity.

Data availability adheres strictly to the defined parameter boundaries. Notably, as previously discussed in section 3.5, no additional parameters are employed beyond those established. This focused approach fortifies the model's robustness while simplifying the calibration process. Given the absence of extraneous parameters, calibration steps and their frequencies are inherently direct, relying on regular monitoring of input data to sustain ongoing relevance and performance.

## Model Testing and Limitations

### Evidence of Previous Testing

The validation of the model has been thoroughly conducted through a comprehensive **Evidence Pack**, which includes session files from the **RiskWatch** platform and a detailed validation spreadsheet. This assessment aims to confirm the accuracy of calculated values, such as prices and Greeks, through comparison against established reference calculations. This validation process is essential in affirming the reliability and efficacy of our pricing models.

The session file utilized for this validation is located at `/groups/gmrm_bu/qsjsx8c/testing/fx_digital/test.scf`, with an attached validation spreadsheet for your reference. It is crucial to recognize that these testing results serve not only as evidence of model performance but also delineate potential limitations, informing future adjustments and enhancements to the model framework.

### Model and Input Data Limitations

The **models** employed in the Murex application differ significantly from those utilized in the GMRM framework. Specifically, Murex employs a **quasi-replication approach**, wherein the **European digital option** is modeled as a basic vanilla option vertical spread. This involves establishing a long position in an option with strike price $ K $ and a short position in a similar option with a higher strike price $ K \cdot (1 + \varepsilon) $. Importantly, while Murex accounts for **volatility skewness**, GMRM opts for a **Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model**. This decision is justified by the following considerations:

- The positioning of the FX digital option in GMRM is deemed **immaterial**, rendering its contribution to **Value at Risk (VaR)** negligible.
- Although the simulation framework incorporates a parallel shift in the **volatility surface**, shifts in the shape of the volatility surface are excluded. However, GMRM does estimate the overall impact of **volatility skewness** across all foreign exchange products.

To maintain the model's integrity, GMRM remains committed to monitoring the materiality of the FX digital option's position. Should its significance escalate, a reevaluation of the modeling approach in GMRM will be warranted, with established vetting processes defining materiality thresholds.

### Quantitative Assessment

The model will be managed within the **Model Risk Management Framework (S08.03.01)** and is subject to a mandated review cycle occurring at least once every three years. This established approach ensures the robustness of GMRMâ€™s modeling practices while enforcing limitations on its application and usage, thereby ensuring proper identification and management of all model limitations.

> *This structured vetting process underscores the necessity for continual assessment, ensuring that emerging materiality or changes in market conditions are appropriately captured.*
